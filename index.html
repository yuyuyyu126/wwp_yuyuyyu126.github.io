    <p>In this lesson we are learning how to use images as webpage content.
       We have already learned that we need to create a folder inside of our 
       root folder and name it images, making sure that it is always written 
       in all lowercase letters for consistency. We then make sure that the
       images we need to use as part of our page were inside of that folder.</p>
		
    <h2>Common Image Formats</h2>

    <img src="images/JinChen05.jpg"  width="220" height="330" /> <figcaption> JinChen is a beautiful girl </figcaption>

    <p>There are many different image formats, but only a handful of them 
       will work on a website. When building a website, a designer must be
       aware of the format types and make sure that the images that will be
       used are saved in the correct format for the image type. The most
       common ones are jpeg, png, and gif.</p>
    <p>The best format type for photographs is jpeg. It has the best results
       for continuous tone images. The best format type for flat color work 
       or illustration work is typically png. Gif formatting is more rare and
       is typically reserved for simple animated images.</p>
